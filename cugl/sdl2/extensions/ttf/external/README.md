# SDL TTF Extensions
---
We currently support both FreeType and HarfBuzz. Fonts
are important to our system, so we are trying for the greatest support possible.

Note that the Makefiles in these directories have been restructured to only support static builds. In addition, all examples and documentation are removed to reduce the code footprint. You should redownload the packages if you need access to full builds.
