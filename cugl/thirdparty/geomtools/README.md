# Geometry Tools
---
This package is a combination of several small, third-party geometry tools that are useful for CUGL. They include

- [Poly2Tri](https://github.com/jhasse/poly2tri), Downloaded 12/23/2022
- [Clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/_Body.htm), Version 6.4.1

### TODO
---
We want to update the Clipper library to [Clipper 2](http://www.angusj.com/clipper2/Docs/Overview.htm).  However, the library as version 1.0.6 does not compile on Android or macOS.
